# WATER QUALITY GROUP PROJECT

## Problem:
### Access to safe drinking water is essential to health and a basic human right, though many developing countries and even parts of the U.S. like Flint, Michigan are living with contaminated drinking water. With the increased prevalence of climate change, drinking water is becoming even more negatively impacted by contaminants. In these instances, non-potable drinking water containing unsafe levels of contaminants can have serious adverse health effects, such as gastrointestinal illnesses, cancer, and transmissible diseases.
### There are various water quality metrics that may contribute to the potability of drinking water. We want to analyze different metrics that may more heavily contribute to water being non-potable which could, in the real world, help formulate effective policy for health protection through implementation of systems that specifically de-contaminate the water of these substances. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

## Guiding Questions:
### 1. What is the distribution of each metric in regards to potable and non-potable water quality and can observations about water potability and selected metrics be made when other metrics are at varied levels?
### 2. How well can machine learning models accurately predict the non-potability of water?
